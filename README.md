This is an extension for Drive Badger. It provides `exclude.list` file, containing a list of exclusions compatible with popular `rsync` program.

The purpose of these exclusions is to decrease the amount of data to be exfiltrated by Drive Badger, and thus to speed up the attack,
by eliminating files and directories, that are not valuable in any way to the attacker:

- games (OEM preinstalled, games installed by users)
- content related to browser games
- game launchers
- other gaming-related tools (except for generic video-recording/streaming software)

### Installing

Clone this repository as `/opt/drivebadger/config/exclude-gaming` directory on your Drive Badger persistent partition.
